    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> and their friends are basketball enthusiasts, they&#39;re also developing a new basketball video game. After months of testing, they&#39;ve noticed the game begins to predict when the AI-controlled teams should commit fouls, but this prediction is greatly skewed. Teams with white-colored jersey avatars statistically commit fewer fouls than the teams with black-colored jersey avatars. Although this was unintentional, they recognize that the coding of their game may implicitly carry a bias. What approach should <span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> and their team do to address the issue?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> should leave it as it is - after all, it&#39;s just a game.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> should let the users figure out their own solution to this problem.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> should apologize to the community without making any code modifications.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> and their team should work to identify the section of their code that is attributing the color of the avatar&#39;s jersey to the chance of committing a foul, and correct it. The AI should consider only factors related to gameplay, e.g., aggression, defense ratings, etc.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Bias, intentional or not, in a game design can reinforce stereotypes and unfair practices. Identifying and rectifying this bias will lead to a more equitable and fair game play. The AI&#39;s decision to commit a foul should be independent of the jersey&#39;s color.</p>",
