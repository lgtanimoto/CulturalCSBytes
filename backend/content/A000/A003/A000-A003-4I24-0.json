    "Question": "<p>Recently, <span class=\"qname\">Milan</span> and their friends have been working on developing an app that can scan a food item&#39;s barcode and provide detailed nutritional information. This could potentially enable people to make healthier food choices. However, a concern arises about the implications that can arise from this app&#39;s mass usage. Which of the following could NOT be one of the impacts of using this app?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Milan</span>&#39;s app is designed to provide nutritional information and with that information, people can make more informed choices. However, whether or not people will make healthier choices based on this new information is highly dependent on personal factors on a case by case basis, and does not directly relate to the economic, social or ethical implications of the app usage.</p>",
