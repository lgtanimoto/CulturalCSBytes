    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> is developing a program that computes the total yardage gained in a football match. Their code initially summed up all yardage without differentiating between teams. However, feedback from users revealed that they would prefer yardage for each team individually. Users also want a message if no yards were gained at all. What modifications should <span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> make to cater to the users&#39; needs?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Split the yardage calculation into two segments, each for a team, and add a conditional clause to output a message if total yardage equals zero.",
    "Answer2": "Remove the yardage calculation entirely as it seems to be confusing the users.",
    "Answer3": "No changes are required as long as the calculation is accurate.",
    "Answer4": "Add more team details to distract the users from the yardage calculation.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,

    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> needs to incorporate the feedback from the users. They can achieve this by segregating the calculation of yardage for each team. Additionally, a conditional clause should be added to check if the total yardage is zero, in which case a suitable message should be displayed.</p>",
