    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Darby</span> is a catcher on their school&#39;s baseball team. They&#39;re trying to create a program that records the number of unsuccessful catches made during a game. The code for <span class=\"qname\">Darby</span>&#39;s procedure is as shown below. However, <span class=\"qname\">Darby</span> notices that the code isn&#39;t functioning as expected. How should <span class=\"qname\">Darby</span> decompose the problem to make the correct sequence of instructions for counting unsuccessful catches?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>integer totalCatches = 0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>integer unsuccessfulCatches = 0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>action recordCatch(boolean isSuccessful)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">totalCatches = totalCatches + 1</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">if isSuccessful == false</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class=\"ci8\">unsuccessfulCatches = unsuccessfulCatches + 1</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">end</div></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>end</td></tr></table></div>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "They should increment the total catches every time and increment unsuccessful catches when the catch is not successful.",
    "Answer2": "They should increment unsuccessful catches every time and total catches when the catch is successful.",
    "Answer3": "They should increment unsuccessful catches only when the catch is not successful.",
    "Answer4": "They should increment total catches only when the catch is successful.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Darby</span> should increment the total number of catches each time a catch is attempted, regardless of whether it is successful or not. The count of unsuccessful catches should only be incremented when a catch is recorded as not successful. This way, the program correctly counts total and unsuccessful catches.</p>",
