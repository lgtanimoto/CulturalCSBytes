		"Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Nashville</span> is sending a message to Memphis using Caesar cipher encryption to keep it a secret from 8-year-old Raleigh. The original message is:</p><p><div class=\"code ci8\">WE WILL EAT PIZZA TONIGHT</div></p><p>The encrypted message is:</p><p><div class=\"code ci8\">DL DPSS LHA WPGGH AVUPNOA</div></p><p>What is the shift value that <span class=\"qname\">Nashville</span> used for the Caesar cipher to encrypt this message?</p>",

		"Explanation": "<p>The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques in which each letter in a message is replaced by a letter that is some fixed number of positions (shift value) down in the alphabet.   With a shift value of <em>7</em>, each letter of the alphabet is replaced as follows:<p><p><div class=\"code ci8\">A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</div></p><p><div class=\"code ci8\">H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G</div></p><p>Because the Caesar cipher is easy to decrypt even without the shift value, it is not used in much in real-life.</p>",
