    "Question": "<p>Charlie is developing an educational game that allows players to navigate a replica of the globe during the Renaissance era using various historical navigational technologies. They need to create a simple scoring system for the game. When a player successfully travels from one location to another, they receive &#39;x&#39; points, where &#39;x&#39; represents the number of nautical miles traveled. Charlie uses the variable &#39;milesTravelled&#39; to track the distance a player has traveled, and &#39;playerScore&#39; to track the player&#39;s score. If a player travels 3000 nautical miles, what will be the value of &#39;playerScore&#39; at the end of the journey?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>number playerScore = 0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>action travel(number milesTravelled) returns integer</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">return playerScore + milesTravelled</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>end action</td></tr></table></div>",

    "Explanation": "<p>According to the game&#39;s scoring system, each successful journey increases the &#39;playerScore&#39; by &#39;x&#39; points, where &#39;x&#39; represents the number of nautical miles traveled. As such, if a player has traveled 3000 nautical miles, their &#39;playerScore&#39; will be increased by 3000 points.</p>",
