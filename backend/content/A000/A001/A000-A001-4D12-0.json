    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Yukon</span> has been studying the Scientific Revolution and the impact new discoveries had during that time. <span class=\"qname\">Yukon</span> decides to create a computational model to represent the relationships among different elements collected from this process, like the relationship between the number of documented discoveries and the increase in scientific publications. Given an increase by 10 documented discoveries, how many scientific publications should <span class=\"qname\">Yukon</span> predict?</p>",
