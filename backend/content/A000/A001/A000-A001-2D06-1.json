    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Asteriod</span> is working on a project about Renaissance navigational technologies and their impact on exploration. To illustrate the relationship between the year of a navigational technology&#39;s invention and the scope of exploration resulting from that technology, <span class=\"qname\">Asteriod</span> decides to use a graphical illustration by generating it with a code. <span class=\"qname\">Asteriod</span> creates the following code snippet:What would <span class=\"qname\">Asteriod</span>&#39;s graph illustrate based on the given code snippet?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>list of NavigationTech navigationalTech = GetNavigationalTechList()</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Integer index = 1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>foreach tech in navigationalTech</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">output tech.getName() + \" was introduced in \" + tech.getYear() + \" and lead to \" + tech.getExplorationCount() + \" expeditions.\"</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">Plot(index, tech.getYear(), tech.getExplorationCount())</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">index = index + 1</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>end</td></tr></table></div>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "The graph shows the relationship between the year of the navigation technology&#39;s introduction and the number of exploratory voyages.",
    "Answer2": "The graph denotes the amount of explorations over the years without any link to navigational technologies.",
    "Answer3": "The graph represents the number of navigational technologies invented during the Renaissance.",
    "Answer4": "The graph shows the number of exploration missions in a given year.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Asteriod</span> has created a mechanism by which they graph the spread of exploration as a result of navigational technologies. As the code iterates over navigationalTech, which is likely a list of technologies with their associated years of invention and the number of explorations resulting from each invention, it plots the associated details on the graph. This suggests a relationship between the year of a technology&#39;s invention and the subsequent spread of exploration.</p>",
