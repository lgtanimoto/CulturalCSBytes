    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> is working on a project about the impact of the printing press during the Renaissance. They want to create a text-based timeline to illustrate the important events led by the invention of the printing press. To make the timeline, they need to develop a program that inputs the year and event and outputs them in chronological order. How should <span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> decompose this problem to make it manageable?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should start by creating a function that sorts the input data and then write a code that inputs the year and event. After that, <span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should create a function to output the data in chronological order.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should first research and write down all the events and their dates. Then, <span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should write a program that prints out these information.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should first create a function that inputs the year and event, develop a function that sorts the data based on the year, and then create a function that outputs the data.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should write code that directly inputs the year and event and outputs them in chronological order. An algorithm or function is not necessary for this process.",

    "Explanation": "<p>In order to break down this problem, <span class=\"qname\">Rebel</span> should first create a function that inputs the year and event, develop a function that sorts the data based on the year, and then create a function that outputs the data.  Each step isolated to an individual function will allow the problem to be solved in smaller, more manageable parts, which can then be combined to solve the overall larger problem.</p>",
