    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span> is a history enthusiast and is currently studying the transportation revolution. They wrote a program to perform a simulation of the amount of data a telegraph can carry from one railway station to another. The telegraph simulation function telegraphDataCarry() carries &#39;speed&#39; bits of data per second. Given a piece of information that has &#39;size&#39; bits, <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s function should return how many seconds it will take to carry that data from one station to another. The function is below</p><p><span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span> calls the function with arguments 2 and 60 (e.g., telegraphDataCarry(2, 60) ), what will be the output of <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s program?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>action telegraphDataCarry(integer speed, integer size)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">output \"It will take \" + size / speed + \" seconds to carry the data.\"</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>end</td></tr></table></div>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "It will take 60 seconds to carry the data.",
    "Answer2": "It will take 30 seconds to carry the data.",
    "Answer3": "It will take 15 seconds to carry the data.",
    "Answer4": "It will take 120 seconds to carry the data.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 2,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Since the telegraph sends 2 bits of data per second, for 60 bits of data, <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s program will output &#39;It will take 30 seconds to carry the data.&#39;</p>",
