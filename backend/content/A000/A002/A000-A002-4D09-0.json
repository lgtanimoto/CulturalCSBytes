    "Question": "<p>Drew has been asked to write a program to extract key financial data from the annual reports of publicly traded companies, which are typically provided in PDF format. Drew used a PDF-to-text conversion library to extract the character data from the PDF.  However, instead of seeing the expected amounts for &#39;Net Income&#39; and &#39;Total Stockholders&#39; Equity&#39;, Drew sees &#39;8 C 1 ow7WWpwXX00&#39; and &#39;-J 0l0&#39;.What is the most likely reason that Drew is not seeing the expected amounts?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Drew did not use a library that can translate from the PDF&#39;s character encoding to Unicode.",
    "Answer2": "The PDF is encrypted and Drew needs to first decrypt the file.",
    "Answer3": "Drew needs to also extract the dollar amounts and percentages using a specialized financial library.",
    "Answer4": "Drew is reading the credit score of the company and not the financial numbers.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>The problem is with character encoding. Each character in a PDF has a unique code that represents each character. However, these codes do not necessarily map directly to the Unicode standard that we normally operate with. Drew is seeing &#39;8 C 1 ow7WWpwXX00&#39; and &#39;-J 0l0&#39; because the conversion library is not correctly decoding the characters. Drew needs a library that can do this or a workaround that correctly translates the characters.</p>",
