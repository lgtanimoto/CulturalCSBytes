    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Milan</span> is taking an entrepreneurship class and for their final project, they are working on a potential start-up idea. They create an online survey and ask their classmates to rate their idea on a scale of 1-5 (1 being Poor and 5 being Excellent). After collecting the data, <span class=\"qname\">Milan</span> got 10 votes for 5, 15 votes for 4, 12 votes for 3, 8 votes for 2, and 5 votes for 1. Which are the best visual formats for <span class=\"qname\">Milan</span> to present this data in class?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Since <span class=\"qname\">Milan</span>&#39;s data is categorical and shows frequency counts for different categories (1-5 ratings), both a bar chart and pie chart can effectively visualize this information. Line graphs and Scatter plots generally illustrate trends over some variable (often time) or relationships between two continuous variables, respectively, so they wouldn&#39;t be as suitable for <span class=\"qname\">Milan</span>&#39;s data.</p>",
