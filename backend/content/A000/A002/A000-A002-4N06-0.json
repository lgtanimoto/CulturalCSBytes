    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> has an idea to create a web application that matches babysitters with families in need. The app requires babysitters to provide extensive personal information and checks this against various public and private databases to ensure babysitters&#39; authenticity. In order to protect the babysitters&#39; personal information, <span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> needs to implement security measures. Which of the following security measures should <span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> potentially employ?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> should store all personal information in plain text and provide open access to all developers to speed up development time.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> should implement strong password protections, enable multi-factor authentication, encrypt all personal information and rigorously control developer access.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> should forgo the background checking aspect of the app to avoid storing potentially sensitive information.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> should sell the personal information to offset the costs of background checks and database authentication.",

    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Protecting personal data is extremely important both ethically and legally, and it should be a priority in any system that handles such data. Using strong password protections, enabling multi-factor authentication (2FA), and encrypting the data provides a layered security approach. Additionally, limiting developer access to production data can help prevent data leaks and breaches.</p>",
