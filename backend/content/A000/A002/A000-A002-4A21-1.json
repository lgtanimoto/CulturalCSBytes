    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> has been assigned to develop a computer program that allows aspiring entrepreneurs to explore and simulate different marketing strategies. The program has mainly four features corresponding to the marketing mix: Product, Price, Place, Promotion. However, users find it difficult to navigate through the features and the array of options each feature provides is overwhelming. <span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> is now tasked with refining the program to make it more accessible and user-friendly. Which of the following modifications should <span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> NOT consider?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Introduce a tutorial showing how each feature is used.",
    "Answer2": "Group options under each feature and introduce a collapsible menu to make navigation easier.",
    "Answer3": "Make the interface more visually appealing.",
    "Answer4": "Remove some options from each feature to simplify the program.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> should not consider removing options from each feature to simplify the program, as this reduces the versatility of the program and may reduce its practicality to users. Reducing features would limit the user\u2019s ability to explore and simulate various strategies. It\u2019s not generally a good idea to remove features unless they add no value or are rarely used. Improving navigation, visual appeal, and providing user guidance via a tutorial are better options to make a program more accessible and user-friendly without compromising its utility.</p>",
