    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> works in a factory building car engines.

Which of the following are appropriate ways for <span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> to present this data visually?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Both a bar chart and a line chart can be used to properly visualize the week-by-week changes in defective parts counted. A pie chart wouldn&#39;t be helpful in this scenario because it is better suited to compare parts of a whole, while in this situation, it is important to show the change of numbers over time.</p>",
