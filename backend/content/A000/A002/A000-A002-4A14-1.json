    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span> works in a clothing factory. Their task is to inspect the finished garments and mark them as &#39;Passed&#39; if they meet the required quality standards and &#39;Failed&#39; if they do not. They are equipped with a computer program that helps them mark the inspection results in a list that stores whether each garment passed or failed.  <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span> wants to quickly find out how many garments failed the quality inspection. How can they modify the program to compute this?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Add a separate variable for each garment to keep track of its status.",
    "Answer2": "Use a loop to iterate over the list and increment a count each time the garment status is &#39;Failed&#39;.",
    "Answer3": "Sort the list in alphabetical order so that all the &#39;Failed&#39; garments are grouped together.",
    "Answer4": "Delete all the &#39;Passed&#39; garments from the list, then count the remaining &#39;Failed&#39; garments.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 2,

    "Explanation": "<p>Using a loop to iterate over the list and increment a count each time the garment status is &#39;Failed&#39; is the most efficient way to solve this problem.</p>",
