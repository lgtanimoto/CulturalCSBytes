    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Discovery</span> should document their design decisions and algorithm flow using text and graphics. Using a software source-code repository like GitHub allows for version control as well as public or private sharing of their code. Detailed design documents give insight into the reasoning and iterative process behind algorithm development. If the work is very significant and meets certain criteria, <span class=\"qname\">Discovery</span> could consider applying for a patent for further protection under intellectual property law.</p>",
