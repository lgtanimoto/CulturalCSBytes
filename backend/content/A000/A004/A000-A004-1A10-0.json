    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> is trying to simulate the gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces acting on a small object in their game. They have code that runs but doesn&#39;t produce the right amount of force. In the code, &#39;g&#39; stands for gravity, &#39;e&#39; for electric, and &#39;m&#39; for magnetic. What change should <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> make to correctly calculate the total force acting on the object?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>number g = 9.81</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>number totalForce = 1.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>number e = 1.0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>number m = 0.5</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>totalForce = totalForce + g</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>totalForce = totalForce + e</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>totalForce = totalForce + m</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>output totalForce</td></tr></table></div>",

    "Answer1": "<span class=\"code\">Modify line 3: <code>totalForce = totalForce + g</code></span>",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"code\">Modify line 4: <code>totalForce = totalForce - e</code></span>",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"code\">Modify line 5: <code>totalForce = totalForce * m</code></span>",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"code\">Modify line 2: <code>number totalForce = 0.0</code></span>",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>In line 2, <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> set the initial totalForce to 1.0. However, this is incorrect because we want to start our sum from 0. <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> should modify line 2 to &#39;number totalForce = 0.0&#39; so that each force is added freshly to the totalForce without any initial conditions affecting the sum.</p>",
