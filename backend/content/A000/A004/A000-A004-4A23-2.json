    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Voyager</span> is creating a program to document the effect of climate change on average weather patterns. They&#39;ve developed an algorithm based on data collected over past years to predict future weather trends. An inspector who&#39;s interested in the logic behind the algorithm is expected to visit. The code for <span class=\"qname\">Voyager</span>&#39;s procedure is as follows:In the absence of <span class=\"qname\">Voyager</span>, how can the inspector gain a decent understanding of the algorithm? </p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "By reading the program code",
    "Answer2": "By reading the user guide of the program",
    "Answer3": "By looking at <span class=\"qname\">Voyager</span>&#39;s documentation where they explains their design decisions, logic, and methodology in great detail",

    "Explanation": "<p>Detailed documentation is the key when it comes to understanding the inner workings of a complex program. In <span class=\"qname\">Voyager</span>&#39;s documentation, design decisions, algorithms, and methods used for the development of the program are explained which would give the inspector a good understanding of it.</p>",
