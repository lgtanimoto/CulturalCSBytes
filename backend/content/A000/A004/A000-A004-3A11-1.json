    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Ellis</span> is calculating the changes in potential energy(PE) and kinetic energy (KE) of an object. They wrote the following program to calculate the potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) of the object, and the changes in PE and KE. What are the variables in this program?</p><codetable>double mass = 2;\ndouble velocity = 3;\ndouble height = 4;\ndouble PE = mass * gravity * height;\ndouble KE = 0.5 * mass * velocity * velocity;\ndouble deltaPE = newPE - PE;\ndouble deltaKE = newKE - KE;</codetable>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"code\"><code>mass, velocity, height, PE, KE, deltaPE, deltaKE</code></span>",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"code\"><code>mass, velocity, height, gravity, newPE, newKE</code></span>",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"code\"><code>mass, velocity, height, gravity</code></span>",
