    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> is tasked with creating a digital simulation that demonstrates the concept of kinetic, potential, and changes in energy as a ball rolls down a ramp. This simulation runs smoothly on a high-performance computer built for gaming. However, on their personal school-issued laptop which has lower power, the simulation freezes and lags. Which aspect of computer science layers of abstraction is <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> experiencing problems with?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Application software",
    "Answer2": "System software",
    "Answer3": "Hardware",
