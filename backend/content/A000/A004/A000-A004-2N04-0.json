    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Trinity</span> is working on a building architecture software that models how information about different parts of the building is transferred over networks. The software takes as input details about the different parts of the building, breaks them down into smaller packets, transfers those packets over a network, and re-assembles the information at the destination. What is the best description for what <span class=\"qname\">Trinity</span>&#39;s software does?</p>",

    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Trinity</span>&#39;s software models buildings and networks but does not transfer any information.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Trinity</span>&#39;s software breaks down, transmits, and re-assembles data about building parts over the internet.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Trinity</span>&#39;s software only re-assembles packets of information on the destination device.",

    "Explanation": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Trinity</span>&#39;s software takes in details about the building, breaks them down into smaller pieces (packets), transfers them over a network, and re-assembles the information at the destination. This process is similar to how data is transferred over the internet.</p>",
