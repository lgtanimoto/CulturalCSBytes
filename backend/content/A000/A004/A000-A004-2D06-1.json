    "Explanation": "<p>A line graph would be the best way to present the data since it can effectively show the relationship between two types of data over a period of time. In this case, the line graph can show the trend of average temperature and rainfall each month. This way, the correlation between a month with high rainfall (peak on one line) and low average temperature (dip on the other line) can be easily seen.</p>",
