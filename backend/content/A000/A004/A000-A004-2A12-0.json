    "Question": "<p>As part of a science project, <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> is creating a computer program that simulates different ecosystems and recommends the best plants and animals to introduce to improve biodiversity. They also want to include a feature where the program suggests alternative species if the recommended ones aren&#39;t available. <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> finds a program online that predicts the impact of introducing a new species to an ecosystem. How should <span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> proceed?</p>",

    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> should not use the existing program because it might be illegal to do so.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Tiger</span> should rewrite the program from scratch because using someone else&#39;s program is considered cheating.",
