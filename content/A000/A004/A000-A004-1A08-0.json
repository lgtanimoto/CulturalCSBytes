    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Karter</span> is creating a computer program to model photosynthesis, a complex biological process that converts carbon dioxide, water, and light into glucose and oxygen. The program follows an algorithm that mirrors the photosynthesis process and creates a graphical representation of how plants convert these raw components into food and energy. Which of the following sequence of steps would be the best representation in <span class=\"qname\">Karter</span>&#39;s program?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light, which provides energy for the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, in <span class=\"qname\">Karter</span>&#39;s program, the sequence of steps should represent this process. The correct sequence is: 1. Absorb light\n2. Combine carbon dioxide and water\n3. Produce glucose and oxygen\n4. Repeat</p>",
