    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> is creating a program for their Biology class that models how plants convert sunlight into glucose through photosynthesis. Their teammate suggested that they could represent the amount of sunlight a plant gets and the amount of glucose it produces as variables `sunlightHours` and `glucoseProduced`. Which of the below feedbacks could <span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> incorporate to refine their program?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Add another variable to represent water because it is an essential ingredient in the process of photosynthesis.",
    "Answer2": "Add a list to store the amount of glucose produced each day, which can be used to track the plant&#39;s output over time.",
    "Answer3": "Change the `sunlightHours` variable to `sunlightMinutes` for a more precise measure of sunlight.",
    "Answer4": "All of the above.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>While `sunlightHours` and `glucoseProduced` are a good start, incorporating other factors like water (which is necessary for photosynthesis) can provide a more accurate model. Storing the amount of glucose produced daily can be helpful for tracking changes over time. Also, measuring sunlight in minutes rather than hours can provide a more precise and accurate measure for photosynthesis.</p>",
