    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> is tasked with creating a software to control a traffic light system. The traffic light system must function as follows: Red light for 60 seconds, then green light for 60 seconds, followed by yellow light for 20 seconds before going back to red light. How should <span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> decompose this task into subproblems?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Create a function that displays a certain color light for a specific amount of time.   Then create a loop that calls this function for the red light, green light, and yellow light for the specifie times.",
    "Answer2": "Start with coding the red light, then consider the other lights.",
    "Answer3": "First conceptualize the entire traffic light system before thinking of any individual components.",
    "Answer4": "Start with coding the green and yellow lights, as they are less common than the red light.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Decomposition involves breaking problems down into manageable parts. In this scenario, the manageable parts could be represented as individual functions controlling each light state and a timer function for time control, which collectively make up the overall traffic light system.</p>",
