    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Jessie</span> is fascinated by genetics and wants to simulate simple inheritance using a computer program. They decide to use boolean variables to represent two genes: curlyHair (where true represents curly hair, false represents straight hair) and brownEyes (where true represents brown eyes, false represents eyes without pigment). How could <span class=\"qname\">Jessie</span> express the concept of a person who inherits curly hair and brown eyes through genetics using these variables?</p>",
