    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> is designing a program to simulate the building process of a skyscraper structure. <span class=\"qname\">Equator</span> wants to ensure their program works as expected and catches any potential problems before implementing on the real site. Which one of the following test cases would NOT be a useful test of <span class=\"qname\">Equator</span>&#39;s program?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Setting the materials&#39; strengths to the maximum possible values on the whole structure and verifying that it stands and performs as expected",
    "Answer2": "Simulating a case where the building is built with the wrong type of material to see how the program reacts and whether it issues a warning",
    "Answer3": "Running a simulation with average mass and strength values for all the materials",
    "Answer4": "Testing if the program prints out a recipe for cooking spaghetti",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Even though it is essential to design a variety of test cases, the spaghetti recipe doesn&#39;t relate to the building architecture, and it would not provide useful or meaningful information on the program&#39;s performance or potential bugs.</p>",
