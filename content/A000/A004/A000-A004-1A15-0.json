    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Green</span> is programming a 3d visualization tool for city planning. The first version should be able to create simple building shapes like rectangular prisms and cylinders. The programming language <span class=\"qname\">Green</span> prefers has built-in methods for drawing shapes, but only 2d shapes such as rectangles and circles. With these 2d shapes, <span class=\"qname\">Green</span> needs to program building formats that the city planning tool can use. What is the best way for <span class=\"qname\">Green</span> to pursue this problem?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Start by creating a function that draws a 2d rectangle or circle, then transform it into a 3d shape",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Green</span> should change the programming language to one that already has 3d shapes built-in",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Green</span> should create a complex function that can draw any 3d shape right away",
    "Answer4": "Create a function that draws a square, then nests this function within another that creates rows of squares, then nests this function within another that creates columns of these rows to create a 3d rectangular prism",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>This problem can be solved by defining simple steps first, such as drawing a square and then building upon these steps, like stacking rows of squares, to create a more complex structure. This is called the iterative process of program development where we start with simpler solutions and gradually make them more complex while reusing the earlier parts.</p>",
