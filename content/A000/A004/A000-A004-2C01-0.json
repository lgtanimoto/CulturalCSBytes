    "Question": "<p>Just as plants perform photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy, storing it as glucose, computers require a power supply to convert electrical energy into a form that is usable by the computer&#39;s components. If <span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span>&#39;s computer suddenly shuts down due to issues with its power supply, what is the most likely effect on the computer&#39;s system and data?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Nothing, as the computer will operate normally once power is restored",
    "Answer2": "Unsaved data will be lost, but saved data and the operating system will remain unaffected",
    "Answer3": "Both saved and unsaved data will be lost, but the operating system will remain unaffected",
    "Answer4": "Both the operating system and all data will be affected",
    "CorrectAnswer": 2,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Any unsaved data will be lost as it is stored in RAM, which is volatile memory that requires a power source to maintain the data it holds. When a computer loses power abruptly, the data in RAM disappears. However, saved data, which is stored on non-volatile storage devices like hard drives and SSDs, remains safe, and the operating system will not be affected as it is also stored in non-volatile memory.</p>",
