    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> is creating a program to represent the biodiversity in different ecosystems. They realize that different ecosystems have different amounts of species, and they want to represent each species with a unique binary number. If an ecosystem has 32 species, what is the minimum bit representation <span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> can use to uniquely identify each species?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "5 bit representation",

    "Explanation": "<p>A 5 bit representation, ranging from 00000 to 11111 in binary, can represent 32 unique possibilities, from 0 to 31 inclusive. This can uniquely represent each one of the 32 species.</p>",
