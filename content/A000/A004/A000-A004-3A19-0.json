    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Darby</span> is working on a program to calculate the level of air pollution at a specific location based on the amount of harmful gases detected in the air. They define initial variables like emissionLevelCO2 (Carbon dioxide), emissionLevelSO2 (Sulfur dioxide), and emissionLevelNO2 (Nitrogen dioxide), but they do not provide any comments or notes about what the variables represent or what types of calculations they are performing. Adding more comments to their code could help others understand and debug the program. What are some suitable places to add comments?</p>",
