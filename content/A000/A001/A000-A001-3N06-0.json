    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Breeze</span> is researching about the electrical revolution and its impact on modern communication. During this, they encountered the concept of encryption and how it became crucial in guaranteeing a secure data transmission. How would <span class=\"qname\">Breeze</span> explain the process of encryption and why it is important in modern communication?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Encryption is the process of masking information so that it becomes readable only if the correct key is applied. It&#39;s not important in modern communication as it only makes the transmission process slower.",
    "Answer2": "Encryption is the conversion of plain information into a coded version, readable only by authorized individuals. It&#39;s important since it eliminates the risk of data theft during transmission.",
    "Answer3": "Encryption scrambles data into a series of random numbers. It adds unnecessary complexity to communication.",
    "Answer4": "Encryption is the transformation of information into an unreadable format. It&#39;s a fairly new development and its significance will become evident in the future.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 2,

    "Explanation": "<p>Encryption is a process that transforms readable data, known as plaintext, into a coded form, called ciphertext, that&#39;s not readable by unauthorized users. It&#39;s crucial in modern communication as it ensures your data is safe from snooping or alteration during transmission. Only the people with the correct encryption key can decrypt and read the data.</p>",
