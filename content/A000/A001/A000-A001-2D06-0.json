    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Madagasgar</span> has a theory that the growth in the number of people with home internet access over the last 20 years has directly influenced the number of people shopping online. They have collected data from their local city office showing the percentage of homes with internet access for each year as well as data showing the sales from online shopping for each year. <span class=\"qname\">Madagasgar</span> wants to present this data to their class.
