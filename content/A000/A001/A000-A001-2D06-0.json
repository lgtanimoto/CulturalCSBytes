        "Explanation": "<p>Chart B shows the number of extremely satisfied students \u2013 not the percentage satisfied.  Chart C, the pie chart, is inappropriate since it implies that the percentages shown have the same denominator.   Chart D, the line chart, is inappropriate because it implies that there is a linear relationship between Ice Cream A, B, and C.</p>",
