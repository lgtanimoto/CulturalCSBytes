        "Explanation": "<p>Document.  An <em>abstraction</em> in computer science is generalizing the details of an object or system to focus attention on details of greater importance.   The operating system provides the abstraction of a document to the word processing program so that the word processing program does not need to figure out how to retrieve a sequential stream of bytes from several fragmented locations on a network.</p>",
