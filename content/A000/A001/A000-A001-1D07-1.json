        "Question": "<p class=\"start_culture\">This question should be customized to appeal to Black high school students.  If you would like to contribute content, please contact <a href=\"mailto:lt@atcsed.org\">lt@atcsed.org</a></p><p><span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span> is writing an article about the best movies of the year for their school newspaper.  To write the article, <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span> created a poll asking students to choose between Movie A, Movie B, Movie C, or Other for &quot;Best Movie.&quot  <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span> then asked four friends from their advanced coding class to each ask ten of their friends to answer the poll for a total of 40 responses.  The poll results are as follows:</p><p class=\"qimg\"><img id=\"qimg0\" class=\"qimg\" src=\"images\\A000-A001-1D07-1Q.png\"><p>In the article, <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span> included the poll results, the poll methodology, and declared that Movie B was the best movie of the year.   However, soon after the article was published, <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span> received several negative comments from both students and teachers about both the methodology and conclusions of the poll.  <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span>'s high school is an urban, multi-ethnic, 9-12 public high school with about 1,600 students</p><p>Which of the following reasons is <em>LEAST LIKELY</em> to be included in the negative comments from <em>TEACHERS</em> about the poll and the article?</p>",
        "QuestionImage": "A000-A001-1D07-1Q.png",
        "Answer1": "To prevent errors in recording student responses, an online survey tool like Google Forms should have been used.",
        "Answer2": "Considering that less than 3% of students were polled, the results were too close to make a definitive statement.",
        "Answer3": "There is an important distinction between &quot;Best&quot; and &quot;Favorite&quot;.  The informal poll was more about popularity than quality.",
        "Answer4": "The students polled by Kauai\u2019s friends in advanced coding class may not be representative of the demographics of the students in Kauai\u2019s high school.",
        "CorrectAnswer": 1,
        "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
        "Explanation": "<p>An online survey tool would make it easier to get more responses and would accurately record the responses.  But as only 40 simple responses were recorded, doing this manually is not a significant problem with this poll. </p><p>However, it is very difficult to create a scientific, representative poll. The students polled are likely to reflect the students in <span class=\"qname\">Kauai</span>'s advanced coding class \u2013 not the entire school.   And considering the small number of students polled, the results are too close \u2013 one vote change could result in a three-way tie \u2013 to definitively state that Movie B was the favorite of all students in the school. </p>",
