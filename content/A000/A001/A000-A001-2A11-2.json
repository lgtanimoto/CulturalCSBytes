    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> is working on a school project about the Renaissance&#39;s influence on technologies and innovations. They decide to create a simulation demonstrating how the printing press revolutionized information dissemination. <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> wants to create a program that simulates the number of books produced before and after the invention of the printing press, based on the input of years passed. Their initial task would be to break down this problem into a manageable subproblem. What subproblem statement would help <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> start the project?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Calculate the number of books produced every year.",
    "Answer2": "Create animations for the printing press.",
    "Answer3": "Simulate the invention of the printing press.",
    "Answer4": "Survey people on their favorite Renaissance inventions.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,

    "Explanation": "<p>Breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks is a fundamental part of problem-solving in computer science. In this case, <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> should begin by creating a simple program that calculates the number of books produced each year based on given variables. They can later incorporate additional conditions to model the effect of the printing press on book production.</p>",
