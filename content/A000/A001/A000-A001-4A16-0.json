    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Zane</span> is developing an interactive timeline detailing societal changes during the Renaissance due to technological progress. They want to initiate different informational pop-ups when the user hovers over or clicks on different events of the timeline. How should <span class=\"qname\">Zane</span> design the computational artifact?</p>",

    "Answer1": "Write a program to display a static timeline with textual information",
    "Answer2": "Include only hover-based instructions without any clickable events",
    "Answer3": "Design a timeline with both hover and click events that will display information about technology during the Renaissance",
    "Answer4": "Create a complex coding script that allows users to edit the timeline themselves",

    "Explanation": "<p>In this scenario, <span class=\"qname\">Zane</span> should develop an interactive timeline. This requires the use of both hover and click events which will initiate instructions to display useful information to the user. A static timeline or a timeline without clickable events will not provide the interactive experience required. Additionally, a script that allows users to edit the timeline can lead to misinformation and is not necessary for their purpose. </p>",
