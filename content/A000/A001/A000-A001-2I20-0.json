    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> is developing a transcribing program that transforms spoken language into written characters for a linguistics project. The software is currently capable of transcribing English speeches into written text successfully. However, when <span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> trialed the software with multiple languages around the world, they found that the software struggled with certain non-roman script based languages. What should <span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> do next to improve the computational artifact?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> should seek the assistance of native speakers of the problematic languages to understand the nuances and complexities that the program is getting wrong.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> should only focus on English as it is the most important language to transcribe.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> should release the software as it is and wait for user complaints to fix the bugs.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Skyler</span> should focus on adding more features to the program instead of making it multi-lingual.",
