    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Dakota</span> is investigating the impact of the Transportation Revolution: the development of canals, railways, and the telegraph on economic growth in the 19th century. <span class=\"qname\">Dakota</span> gathered data on the length of railway and canal networks and the number of telegraph stations in every five year period for a century. How would <span class=\"qname\">Dakota</span> write a program to calculate total growth for each transportation technology over the century?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>For this problem, we need to calculate the total growth of the railway, canal and telegraph networks over a century. We accomplish this by initializing a variable for each network at 0, and then in each five-year interval, adding the length of new construction to the respective variable. At the end of the century, we print the variables, which now represent the total growth of each network over the whole century. In this manner, we use variables to store and continuously modify data.</p>",
