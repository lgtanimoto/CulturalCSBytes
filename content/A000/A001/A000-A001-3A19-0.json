    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Robin</span> has written a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on the user&#39;s input. This program was inspired by the discovery of the concept of Pi by the ancient Greeks. <span class=\"qname\">Robin</span>&#39;s program works fine, but their classmates are finding it hard to understand what each part does. What kind of code comments should <span class=\"qname\">Robin</span> add to improve their classmates&#39; understanding?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>import math</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>radius = input(&#39;Enter the radius of the circle: &#39;)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>area = math.pi * pow(radius, 2)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>print(&#39;Area of the circle is&#39;, area)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>print(&#39;Circumference of the circle is&#39;, circumference)</td></tr></table></div>",

    "Answer1": "<span class=\"code\"><code>// This code is inspired by the achievements of ancient Greeks</code></span>",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"code\"><code>// This is a code that calculates the area and circumference of a circle</code></span>",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"code\"><code>// This section asks for the user&#39;s input for the radius of the circle and must be a positive number</code></span>",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"code\"><code>// This section calculates the area using the formula Pi*radius*radius and the circumference using the formula 2*Pi*radius</code></span>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Code comments should describe what the code does, how it does it, why it does it, and any special considerations or assumptions made. Answer 4 is the best comment because it not only describes what the code does, but also how it does it - the process of computation, the input requirements, and the meaning of the output.</p>",
