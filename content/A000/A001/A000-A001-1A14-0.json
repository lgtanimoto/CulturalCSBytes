If you would like to contribute content, please contact <a href=\"mailto:lt@atcsed.org\">lt@atcsed.org</a></p><p><span class=\"qname\">Jude</span> is writing a program to find the coldest temperature in the previous year.  <span class=\"qname\">Jude</span> has a list of the low temperature for each day that looks as follows:</p><br><div class=\"code\"><div class=\"ci8\">23.5</div><div class=\"ci8\">21.7</div><div class=\"ci8\">43.0</div><div class=\"ci8\">\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</div><div class=\"ci8\">\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</div><div class=\"ci8\">35.9</div></div><p>The original program runs but gives the wrong answer:</p><br><p class=\"qimg\"><img id=\"qimg0\" class=\"qimg\" src=\"images\\A000-A001-1A14-0Q.png\"></p><br><p>What change should <span class=\"qname\">Jude</span> make to fix the program and output the coldest temperature?</p>",

        "Answer1": "Modify line 4:<span class=\"code\"> if dayCold &gt; maxCold</span>",
        "Answer2": "Modify line 4:<span class=\"code\"> if dayCold = maxCold</span>",

        "CorrectAnswer": 4,
        "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
        "Explanation": "<p>Because <em>maxCold</em> is set so low in line 1, line 4 is never true and <em>maxCold</em> will always be -1000.0.   By modifying line 1 to <span class=\"code\">maxCold = 1000.0</span> - higher than any expected value, the first value read from the list will become the initial <em>maxCold</em> and the program will work as expected.</p>",
