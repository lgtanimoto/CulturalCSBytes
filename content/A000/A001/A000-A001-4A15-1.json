    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span> is developing an algorithm to simulate the signal transmission between two devices using electric pulses. They selected to implement this using a loop structure. The concept behind this is that every transmitted signal pulse will iterate through the loop until it reaches its destination. <span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span>&#39;s classmate questions the use of this implementation, believing a recursion method would have been more efficient. How should <span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span> justify their choice?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span> can justify by explaining that recursion may have been more complicated to comprehend and would also consume more memory due to continuous stack frame creation for every function call.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span> can justify by saying that they selected the loop because they were unsure of how recursion works.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span> can justify by stating that the loop allows faster execution, since the program doesn&#39;t need to handle and manage many recursive function calls.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Kendall</span> can justify by explaining that the loop provides better readability and the signal transmitted in real life is an iterative process, hence more accurately modeled by a loop rather than recursion.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 4,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>The decision between recursion and iteration involves a tradeoff between implementation, readability, and program performance. While recursion can often provide elegant solutions to certain types of problems, a loop structure can be easier to understand and debug, and may provide better performance as it does not require the overhead of repeated function calls. This is particularly true in a problem such as simulating a iterative process like signal transmission.</p>",
