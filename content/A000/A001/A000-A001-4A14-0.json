    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> is working on a project on the impact of the Renaissance and the Printing Press. They want to create a timeline of the 10 most significant events happening during this period. Each event will have a year and a brief description. How should <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> store this information in their program?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Create a simple variable for each event&#39;s year and description",
    "Answer2": "Create a list with just the years of the events",
    "Answer3": "Create a list of 10 tuples, with each tuple containing the year of an event and a brief description",
    "Answer4": "Create a list with just the descriptions of the events",
    "CorrectAnswer": 3,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Since each event has a year and a description, and we have multiple events, it makes sense to create a list of tuples. In each tuple, one element could store the year, and the other element could store the description. This approach simulates a &#39;bag&#39; of events, where each event is represented by a couple (year, description).</p>",
