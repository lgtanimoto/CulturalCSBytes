        "Explanation": "<p>There are three conditions that the prediction must cover: 1) if the temperature is greater than 85 degrees, then all 50 bottles are sold; 2) if the temperature is less than 45 degrees, then 0 bottles are sold 3) if the temperature is between 45 and 85 degrees, there is a linear relationship between the number of popsicles sold and the temperature.   Only <span class=\"qcanswer\">Answer A</span> correctly handles all 3 conditions.</p> ",
