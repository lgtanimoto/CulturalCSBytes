    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> is helping their friend Aoki with a coding assignment that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron&#39;s formula. The initial code developed by Aoki was giving the wrong answers, but <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> worked collaboratively made a few changes that fixed the code. It underwent several iterations before becoming correct, but <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> forgot to document what changes they made to fix the errors. What would be the appropriate explanation <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span> should provide to describe the changes they made?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>action Main</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">number side1 = 5.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">number side2 = 3.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">number side3 = 7.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">number semiPerimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">number area = squareRoot(semiPerimeter * (semiPerimeter - side1) * (semiPerimeter - side2) * (semiPerimeter - side3))</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">output \"Area of the triangle is \"+ area</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>end</td></tr></table></div>",

    "Answer1": "I just combined a couple of variables and functions without following any particular process.",
    "Answer2": "I changed the algorithm multiple times and somehow it worked in the end.",
    "Answer3": "I tested the program after each change, adjusted different parts of the code based on the error messages and incorrect outputs until it produced the correct area calculations.",
    "Answer4": "I tried different things until it worked, but I can&#39;t exactly recall what those were.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 3,

    "Explanation": "<p>An integral part of the development of any code involves the process of debugging and refining it multiple times, termed as the iterative process. In <span class=\"qname\">Taylor</span>&#39;s case, they meticulously tested the code after every change, identified errors, and made necessary corrections until the code started producing the correct results. Such a process of trial and error using organized testing and debugging is a typical coding practice in iterative development.</p>",
