		"Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> has an exciting idea for a new app that they think can make millions of dollars in sales over the next three years.   After an exhaustive search on the Internet, <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> finds a competitor app that does about 75 percent of <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span>'s idea but is slow and has an ugly and difficult-to-use user interface.   This competitor app displays a copyright notice when it first launches.</p><p>Which one of the following is a reason why <span class=\"qname\"><span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span></span> may wish that copyright laws were different in the United States?</p>",
		"QuestionImage": null,
		"Answer1": "By placing a copyright on their app once it is completed, <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> can protect themselves from having their ideas stolen or copied.",
		"Answer2": "Copyright laws promote the free flow of information and ideas in society.",
		"Answer3": "The copyright on the competitor app will make it difficult for <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> to use it as a starting point for their app.",
		"Answer4": "By placing a copyright of their app once it is completed, <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> will have to pay 30% of all its revenue to the U.S. government.",
		"CorrectAnswer": 3,
		"FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
		"Explanation": "<p><p>Copyright is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship including computer programs as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression.   Although <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> may develop their app independently of its competitor, they may not use or copy the code of the competitor app without permission.  Once <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> completes their app, their app is protected by copyright as soon as it is published.   Further, <span class=\"qname\">Galaxy</span> can get a registered copyright for their app from the U.S. government for a nominal fee (usually less than $100)</p></p>",
