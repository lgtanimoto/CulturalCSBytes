		"Question": "<p>Ocean has learned that the first letter in their name 'O' has the same binary encoding (01001111) as the number 79.   Because remembering the binary digits of 'O' is difficult, Ozark wants to remember the hexadecimal encoding.</p><p>What is the hexadecimal encoding for the letter 'O'</p>",

		"Explanation": "<p>Hexadecimal is base 16 with digits 0 -  9 and A – F for 11 through 15.   One can convert from binary to hexadecimal by taking the binary digits four at a time.  '1111' is 'F' and '0100' is '4'.   Thus '4F' is the hexadecimal representation of the letter 'O'.</p>",
