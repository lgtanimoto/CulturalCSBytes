		"Question": "<p>At school, <span class=\"qname\">Chile</span> uses a programming language with code statements to draw lines, circles, triangles, and rectangles filled with 16 different colors on a 400-by-400-pixel grid.   Chile can write programs that combine these code statements with variables, loops, conditionals, and procedures. </p><p>Based on this description, which one of the following could NOT be created with this programming language?</p>",

		"Answer3": "A program tracking the birthday of every student in class",
		"Answer4": "A pyramid of 10 circles stacked upon each other 4 - 3 - 2 - 1",
		"CorrectAnswer": 3,
		"FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
		"Explanation": "<p>Different programming languages or libraries of programming languages have different strengths and uses.   Use the right programming language or library for the right task.  The programming language that <span class=\"qname\">Chile</span> uses provides basic drawing functionality but may not be of any help in tracking student birthdays.   A programming language that provided simple spreadsheet or database functionality would be more useful for tracking birthdays. </p>",
