		"Question" : <p>When <span class="qname">Rowan</span> runs one or two applications on a school laptop, these applications run fast even if the applications need to retrieve big files from the Internet.   However, if <span class="qname">Rowan</span> has several applications and several browser windows and tabs open at the same time, everything seems to slow down.  Where is the likely source of the bottleneck causing this slowdown<p>",

		"Answer1": "A computer virus",
		"Answer2": "A slow remote Internet server",
		"Answer3": "A slow graphics card",
		"Answer4": "A lack of RAM (Random Access Memory)",
		"CorrectAnswer": 4,
		"FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
		"Explanation": "<p>A lack of RAM (Random Access Memory) is the most likely culprit as every application, browser window/tab that is open uses up some RAM even if it is not active.   But computer performance is often tricky to debug.   A computer virus that uses up system resources, but whose effects are not evident until many applications are open is another possibility.   A slow remote Internet server or graphics card may affect a particular application and indirectly the entire system, but the type of application running is not mentioned in this question.</p>",
