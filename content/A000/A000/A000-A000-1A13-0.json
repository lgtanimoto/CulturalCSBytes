		"Question" : "<p>When creating a promotional website for a friend’s band, <span class=\"qname\">Luca</span> finds a professional, close-up photo on another friend’s Instagram of a famous musician with over ten billion song views on YouTube.   <span class=\"qname\">Luca</span> wants to use the Instagram photo to show how the famous musician has inspired many of the songs performed by the band.   What should <span class=\"qname\">Luca</span> do?",
		"QuestionImage" : null,
		"Answer1": "Avoid using the photo because the copyright owner of the photo is unknown",
		"Answer2": "Download the photo from Instagram and post it to the band’s website without attribution.  The copyright owner is unknown, and the photo is of a famous person",
		"Answer3": "Download the photo from Instagram and post it to the band’s website with attribution by providing a link to Instagram.",
		"Answer4": "Take a screen snapshot of the photo from Instagram and save it.   You now own the copyright to the photo so can post it to the band website without attribution.",
		"CorrectAnswer": 1,
		"FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
		"Explanation": "<p>Because the photo is a close-up professional photo of a famous person, it is highly unlikely that the friend is the copyright owner of the photo.  Instagram is also not the copyright owner. You should only use photos you have taken, a person has given you permission to use, or where copyright, usage, and attribution information are clear. </p>",
