    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span> is a budding entrepreneur who has come up with an excellent idea for a new app. They know that their app (which is the application software) has to interact with various layers of the system like the operating system (system software) and the hardware of the device it will run on. If <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span> is operating their application on a smartphone, which of the following best describes a direct interaction between the application software and a hardware component?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s app sending a notification which lights up the screen of the smarthphone.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s app getting an OS update.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s app being downloaded from an app store.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s app changing the brightness of the screen when the phone is unlocked.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 1,

    "Explanation": "<p>The Screen of a smartphone is a hardware component. When <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s app sends a notification, the application software directly interacts with the hardware by making it light up. <span class=\"qname\">Spencer</span>&#39;s app changing the brightness of the screen is also a direct interaction but only happens if the phone is unlocked which is a condition dependent on the System Software (OS). Hence, Answer 1 is a more direct interaction.</p>",
