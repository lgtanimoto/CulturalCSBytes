        "Question": "<p class=\"start_culture\">This question should be customized to appeal to Hispanic-Latinx high school students.  If you would like to contribute content, please contact <a href=\"mailto:lt@atcsed.org\">lt@atcsed.org</a></p><p><span class=\"qname\">Lava</span> is writing a program to count the number of each type of animal on various farms based on a picture of each animal.   A code snippet from the initial iteration of <span class=\"qname\">Lava</span>'s program looks as follows:</p><p class=\"qimg\"><img id=\"qimg0\" class=\"qimg\" src=\"images\\A000-A002-3A11-0Q.png\"></p><p>The use of the variable names <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> make this code snippet difficult to understand.   Which of the following replacements for the variable names <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> would make this code the easiest to understand?",
        "QuestionImage": "A000-A002-3A11-0Q.png",
        "Answer1": "<em>a</em>: horse, <em>b</em>: isHorse, <em>c</em>: horses",
        "Answer2": "<em>a</em>: textAnimal, <em>b</em>: isHorse, <em>c</em>: countAnimal",
        "Answer3": "<em>a</em>: countAnimal, <em>b</em>: isAnimal, <em>c</em>: textAnimal",
        "Answer4": "<em>a</em>: textStudent, <em>b</em>:isStudent, <em>c</em>:countStudent",
        "CorrectAnswer": 2,
        "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
        "Explanation": "<p>Variable <em>b</em> holds a yes/no value of whether a picture is of a horse.  Variable <em>a</em> and <em>c</em> could be used for any type of animal.  Variable <em>a</em> is a text string with the name of the animal; variable <em>c</em> is the count of the animal type, and variable <em>c</em> contains the count of horses - 1 if the picture was a horse or 0 otherwise.</p>",
