    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> is starting to budget and plan their financials. They think it&#39;s important to keep track of their receipts. <span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> scans all receipts and saves them on their phone. To protect these important financial documents, what steps should <span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> take to secure their electronic information?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> should store all scanned receipts on a thumb drive and hide it.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> should set a passcode on their phone to restrict unauthorized access. They should also use a secure app to store the scanned images and frequently backup the data to a trusted virtual cloud storage.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> does not need to do anything since scanned documents can\u2019t be stolen or lost.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> should share the scanned images with a trusted friend for safekeeping.",

    "Explanation": "<p>Setting up a passcode, use of secure app and consistent back-up are beneficial security measures that <span class=\"qname\">Emery</span> should perform to protect their electronic information. Sharing private information even with trusted ones can potentially risk its security. Copying data only to a thumb drive doesn&#39;t secure it against data loss and storing data on phone without security also risk theft or unauthorized access.</p>",
