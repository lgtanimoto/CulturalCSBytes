    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Frankie</span> has been researching how packets of data are transmitted over the internet. To help their classmates understand, <span class=\"qname\">Frankie</span> likens the process to a pizza delivery system, where a pizza (the data) is divided into slices (packets) and each slice is transported separately before being assembled again at the destination (the end device). Is this analogy accurate, and why?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Yes, because each slice is the same size and contains the same ingredients, just like each data packet is the same size and contains the same information.",
    "Answer2": "No, because a pizza can only be baked all at once, whereas data packets can be transmitted simultaneously over different routes.",
    "Answer3": "Yes, because both systems ensure that every slice arrives at its destination, even if it takes a different route than the others.",
    "Answer4": "No, because pizza slices can get lost or damaged during delivery, whereas data packets are always transmitted perfectly without any loss or damage.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 3,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Just like a pizza is split into slices, information is broken into smaller packets for transmission. And just as each pizza slice might take a different route but still arrives at its final destination, each data packet might take a different route through the network but is reassembled at the receiving device to form the complete message.</p>",
