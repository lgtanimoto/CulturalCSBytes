    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> is developing an inventory management program for their family&#39;s grocery store. <span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> noticed that the application used by their cousin&#39;s hardware store has a useful feature for tracking stock. How can <span class=\"qname\">Chengdu</span> use this for their grocery inventory management program dynamically to monitor and update grocery items in stock?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "By completely rewriting the program and only borrowing the UI design",
    "Answer2": "By copying the entire application&#39;s code and using it as their own",
    "Answer3": "By identifying the parts of the cousin&#39;s application that deals with stock tracking and incorporating similar logic into their grocery program",
    "Answer4": "By creating an entirely new feature that&#39;s unrelated to stock tracking",
    "CorrectAnswer": 3,

    "Explanation": "<p>The best approach would be to understand, modify and incorporate only the parts of the cousin&#39;s program that handle stock tracking - this aligns with the principle of reusing and remixing existing code to create something new or add more features to a program.</p>",
