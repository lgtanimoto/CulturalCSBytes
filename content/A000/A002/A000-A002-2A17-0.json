        "Explanation": "<p><em>ProcB</em> takes two numbers as parameters and returns the smaller one.   By calling <em>ProcB</em> several times, <em>ProcA</em> can take four numbers as parameters and return the smallest one.   Because the code in <em>ProcA</em> and <em>ProcB</em> returns values rather than output them to the screen, the results of <em>ProcA</em> and <em>ProcB</em> are not printed to the screen.</p>",
