        "Explanation": "<p>Two-factor authentication such as typing in a code sent to a mobile phone owned by the user is a common way to provide a more secure computing environment.   While these other methods suggested would provide more security, they would greatly limit the usefulness of the computing environment beyond the security benefit they would provide.</p>",
