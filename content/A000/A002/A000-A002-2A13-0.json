    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span> is creating a program that tracks their monthly expenses considering their income and spending on rent, food, and entertainment. Given the following code snippet, what will be the output when <span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span>&#39;s income is $5000, and their expenses are as follows: rent $2000, food $1500, entertainment $500?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>integer income = 5000</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>integer rent = 2000</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>integer food = 1500</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>integer entertainment = 500</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>integer remaining = income - (rent + food + entertainment)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>if remaining &lt; 0</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">output \"Budget status: Warning!

    "Answer1": "Budget status: Good job! You have saved $1000 this month.",
    "Answer2": "Budget status: Warning! You have overspent by $1000 this month.",
    "Answer3": "Budget status: Good job! You have saved $2000 this month.",

    "Explanation": "<p>The program calculates <span class=\"qname\">Haskell</span>&#39;s remaining budget by subtracting their total expenses from their income. In this case, $5000 - ($2000 + $1500 + $500) equals $1000. As this remaining amount is not less than 0, the message &#39;Good job! You have saved $1000 this month.&#39; gets output.</p>",
