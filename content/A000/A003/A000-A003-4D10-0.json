    "Question": "<p>For their final computing project, <span class=\"qname\">Dakota</span>, a member of the school&#39;s cross country team, decided to create a running app that organizes and stores personal fitness data. <span class=\"qname\">Dakota</span> wants to include an array list of this week&#39;s running distances in miles and an array of how long it took in minutes. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the data storage solutions in this context.</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "Array lists and arrays both store and organize data in an efficient manner, but arrays are static and cannot hold data types.",
    "Answer2": "Although an array offers faster access time, it is not dynamic. Array lists are dynamic in size but offer less efficient access.",
    "Answer3": "Arrays are dynamic and can hold multiple data types, while array lists are static and cannot hold multiple data types.",
    "Answer4": "Array lists can hold more than one data type and have a dynamic size, but have longer access times. Arrays have quicker access times but are fixed in size and can only hold one data type.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 2,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>In this scenario, while an array could be more time efficient, an array list might be more beneficial for <span class=\"qname\">Dakota</span> because the team&#39;s running distances could vary each week. The array list&#39;s ability to dynamically resize could accommodate these varying amounts of data, albeit with a slightly slower access time. An array, on the other hand, is fixed in size and can only hold one data type, but has quicker access times.</p>",
