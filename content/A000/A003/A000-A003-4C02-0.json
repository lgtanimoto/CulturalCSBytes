    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Riley</span> is creating an application to track their daily food intake and calculate their total daily calories. The application has a user-interface where <span class=\"qname\">Riley</span> can enter the type and quantity of food they eat each day. Behind the scenes, the application has a database that stores the nutritional information of each food item. When <span class=\"qname\">Riley</span> enters a food item, the application uses system software to access the hardware, compute the total calories, and return the result to <span class=\"qname\">Riley</span>. Which step demonstrates the interaction between the application software and system software?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>The application software (food intake tracker app) interacts with the system software when it needs to access the hardware (computer&#39;s CPU and memory) to perform tasks like fetching data from the database and calculating total calories. The system software manages these hardware resources and allows the app to use them.</p>",
