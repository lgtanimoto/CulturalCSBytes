    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> is the coach of a high school basketball team and they have just started using an online tool to manage their team&#39;s strategy and performance data. The tool recommends enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect their account. However, <span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> is concerned about the inconvenience this may cause during critical moments of games. What is the best course of action for <span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span>?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "<span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> should disregard the 2FA recommendation and focus on keeping the username and password secure.",
    "Answer2": "<span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> should enable 2FA for the account but share the 2FA codes with the team for convenience.",
    "Answer3": "<span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> should enable 2FA as it adds an additional layer of security, but also have a backup access plan for critical moments.",
    "Answer4": "<span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> should not use the platform at all to avoid security risks.",
    "CorrectAnswer": 3,
    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Two factor authentication adds a second level of authentication to an account log-in. While it may be less convenient as it requires an additional step to sign in, it&#39;s a much stronger defense against threats. However, <span class=\"qname\">Jaime</span> should also have a backup plan in case access to the second factor (like a mobile phone) is lost, especially during critical moments. Sharing passwords or 2FA codes weakens security and should be avoided.</p>",
