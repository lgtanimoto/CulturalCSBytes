    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Morgan</span> is studying sports psychology and interested in the impact of mental state on a player&#39;s performance. They collect data on their own performance in chess matches, documenting their feelings of stress before each match and the outcome of each game. Upon creating a scatterplot, they observe a clear pattern between increased stress and greater likelihood of losing. <span class=\"qname\">Morgan</span> wonders if they can use these findings to estimate their future performance. Which of the following would best represent a computational model for <span class=\"qname\">Morgan</span>&#39;s investigation?</p>",
    "QuestionImage": null,
    "Answer1": "A list of stress measurements",
    "Answer2": "A bar chart displaying the number of games won vs. lost",
    "Answer3": "A scatter plot with a trend line showing a correlation between stress level and game outcome",
    "Answer4": "A diagram showing the layout of a chess board",

    "Explanation": "<p>A computational model that best represents <span class=\"qname\">Morgan</span>&#39;s investigation is a scatter plot with a trend line showing a correlation between stress level and game outcome. This model successfully represents the relationship between two different elements of data, indicating a clear pattern and allowing for future predictions.</p>",
