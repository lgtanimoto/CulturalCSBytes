    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Phoenix</span> is writing code for their school&#39;s drill team to evaluate each team member&#39;s steps according to the synchronized rhythm. <span class=\"qname\">Phoenix</span>&#39;s peer is struggling to understand the function below. What explanatory comment should <span class=\"qname\">Phoenix</span> provide for this code snippet?</p><div class=\"ci8\"><table class=\"codetable\"><tr><td width=\"4em\">1</td><td>action rhythmEvaluator(integer total_steps, integer steps_not_in_rhythm)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class=\"ci4\">return ((total_steps - steps_not_in_rhythm) / total_steps) * 100</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>end</td></tr></table></div>",

    "Answer1": "// The function takes two parameters and calculates their product",
    "Answer2": "// The function calculates the sum of total steps and steps not in rhythm in a dance routine",
    "Answer3": "// The function calculates the percentage of steps in rhythm in a dance routine",
    "Answer4": "// The function provides the difference between total steps and steps in rhythm in a dance routine",
    "CorrectAnswer": 3,

    "Explanation": "<p>The function rhythmEvaluator takes two parameters: total_steps and steps_not_in_rhythm. It calculates the difference between total_steps and steps_not_in_rhythm, divides it by total_steps and then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage of steps in rhythm. Hence <span class=\"qname\">Phoenix</span> should advise the peer that the function calculates the percentage of steps in rhythm in a dance routine.</p>",
