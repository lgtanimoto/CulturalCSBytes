    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Jessie</span> loves American football and statistics. They are working on a project to collect and analyze football statistics for their Computer Science course. <span class=\"qname\">Jessie</span> has data like scores, team names, player information, and duration of games. They want to devise a novel way to represent this data using multiple encoding schemes. Which of the following is unlikely to benefit <span class=\"qname\">Jessie</span> in effectively presenting the data?</p>",
