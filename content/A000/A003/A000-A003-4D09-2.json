    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Xen</span>, a soccer enthusiast, decides to create a program that will predict the outcome of a soccer match based on the positions of all the players, ball, and goals. In order to accomplish this, <span class=\"qname\">Xen</span> needs to create a representation of the players&#39; positions using bits. Consider an 8-bit number where the first four bits represents the x-coordinate and the last four bits represents the y-coordinate. The position of a player is represented as &#39;11010101&#39;. What does this translate to in the real-world x,y coordinates of a soccer field?</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>An 8-bit number is divided into two 4-bit numbers, with each 4-bit number being a number from 0 to 15. By converting each 4-bit number from binary to decimal, we get &#39;1101&#39; as 13 and &#39;0101&#39; as 5. Therefore, the player&#39;s coordinates on a real-world soccer field would be x:13, y:5.</p>",
