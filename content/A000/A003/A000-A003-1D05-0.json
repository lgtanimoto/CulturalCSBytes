    "Question": "<p><span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> is the statistician for their school&#39;s softball team. They are asked to calculate Batting Average, a statistic calculated by dividing the number of hits by the number of at-bats. At the end of a recent game, <span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> realized they accidentally deleted their teammate Jordan&#39;s data. <span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> remembers that Jordan had a batting average of 0.370 and 27 at-bats. Using this information, can <span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> calculate the number of hits Jordan had? If so, how?</p>",

    "Answer1": "No, <span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> can&#39;t calculate the number of hits because the data was deleted.",
    "Answer2": "Yes, by multiplying Jordan&#39;s batting average by the number of at-bats.",
    "Answer3": "Yes, by dividing Jordan&#39;s batting average by the number of at-bats.",
    "Answer4": "Yes, by subtracting Jordan&#39;s batting average from the number of at-bats.",

    "FixedOrderFromBottom": 0,
    "Explanation": "<p>Yes, <span class=\"qname\">Ziv</span> can multiply Jordan&#39;s batting average by the number of at-bats to calculate number of hits. The formula would be as follows: Hits = batting average * at-bats = 0.370 * 27 = 9.99. In baseball statistics, we would round this down to 9 hits.</p>",
