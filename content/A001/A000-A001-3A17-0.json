If you would like to contribute content, please contact <a href=\"mailto:lt@atcsed.org\">lt@atcsed.org</a></p><p><span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span> is coding a procedure that will take a temperature in Celsius as an parameter and print out whether water will become ice ( <= 0\u00b0 ), boil ( >= 100\u00b0) or remain water.   The code for <span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span>'s procedure is as follows:</p><p class=\"qimg\"><img id=\"qimg0\" class=\"qimg\" src=\"images\\A000-A001-3A17-0Q.png\"></p><p>For which of the following calls to <span class=\"code\">waterState()</span> will <span class=\"qname\">Surfer</span>'s procedure output misleading results?</p>",

        "Explanation": "<p>At a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, <span class=\"code\">waterState()</span> will output both the phrase <emp>\"Water will boil\"</emp> AND the phrase <emp>\"Water will not freeze or boil\"</emp>.   <span class=\"code\">waterState()</span> should use a single if \u2013 elseif \u2013 else conditional for the best results. </p>",
